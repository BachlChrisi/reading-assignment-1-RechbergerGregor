## Basic Communcation Scheme in the [World Wide Web](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web)
### Overview
In a very simplified view on the web we see two main parties:

- The *web server*
- The *web client*

Both parties communicate over the internet using a special protocol, known as *[Hyper Text Transfer Protokol (http)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Transfer_Protocol)*. The technical details of http and lower protocol layers, like tcp/ip and others are not part of this course.

To make all resources in the Web accessible and addressable so called *[Unified Resource Locators (url)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/URL)* are used.

Content is encoded as so called [*html* pages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTML).
